          <h2 class="section-name">Overview</h2>
          <p>I’ve always been interested in psychology and how the mind works. In junior high, my friend and I came up with a concept to share your thoughts without being identified (similar to Twitter). <br><br>Fast forward to today, I’ve taken a new approach on this concept with an offline app that allows you to share your thoughts without fear of the information being stored, manipulated, or read by someone else.</p>

          <p>Thankfully there's no one to compete with! Unlike apps such as Daylio, Uplifter, and Moodnotes, Blah does not track any progress of your emotions. Emotion tracking is pretty helpful for people with a therapist. It may not be effective for those that would rather vent and forget.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't want my thoughts recorded anywhere for anyone to grab; Would you? After a message is complete on BLAH, it gets swiped away and no information is stored. <br><br>The call feature behaves the same way. Nothing is recorded before, during, or after a call. It's just you yelling at your phone until you feel better. You won't hurt it's feelings, I promise.</p>

              <p>The app does not replace therapy. I'm a big advocate for getting help when people need it most. It is meant as a forgetful journal and not to replace human interaction and comfort. <br><br> If a user feels like harming themselves, I’ve implemented a contact button to the National Suicide Prevention Line phone number next to the BLAH call button. This button actually calls the hotline so it should only be used in real emergencies.</p>

          <p>Have you gone to therapy? It's expensive! It would be great to provide quality therapy to those that can't afford it.<br><br> For an intermediate step, I'd love to test a chatbot custom to each user that adapts to how they speak and allow the user to reflect on their thoughts. Implementing this on both the message and phone features would be awesome but extremely difficult to filter out negative self-speak.<br><br>Through a guided thought process, the chatbots can help users come to their own conclusions and feel accomplished to have come closer to solving their current problem.</p>

          <h2 class="section-name">Overview</h2>
          <p>Being in and out of the CUNY System for almost a decade, I've had the opportunity to experience a majority of their products. Being a decade old in 2019, CUNYfirst has not changed technologies at all (confirmed with faculty). <br><br> With technologies like React, Node.js, and Amazon Web Services, this product can be revamped and be functional for students.</p>

                  <h4 class="bold cuny-primary-blue-text">Problem</h4>
                  <p>CUNYfirst is a distributed product to many Universities. CUNY hasn't tackled this issue because of the cost of changing the product across many schools. However, as new tech appears, Universities might turn to more modern products and students continue to suffer with a bug-ridden product that has no mobile capabilities.</p>

              <article>
                  <h4 class="bold cuny-primary-blue-text">Goal</h4>
                  <p>Because the product is so large, I chose to design a mobile version of CUNYfirst. More users handle everything on their phone and with no mobile capabilities, the product is harder to access. The redesign has similar functionality to the current web-app, but completely redesigned for mobile devices.</p>

              <article>
                  <h4 class="bold cuny-primary-blue-text">Approach</h4>
                  <p>I.A. Restructuring, user research and testing, new approaches to mobile navigation, and a lot of trial and error.</p>
              </article>
              <article>
                  <h4 class="bold cuny-primary-blue-text">Solution</h4>
                  <p>The user base is massive for this app so I took a gestureless approach to the web app. Through buttons and easily digestable information, the user doesn't feel overwhelmed by the amount of accessible content. I'm currently working on a more refined approach to the navigation as well.</p>

              <p>Even though anyone can use the app, based on the statistics I found, 18-29 year old females would be the main user demographic.<br><br>About 50% of all age groups imagine they would use an app for stress and anxiety relief, while only 8% on average use them regularly. The odds aren't looking great for long-term use of the app but let's be hopeful.</p>

          <p>Thankfully there's no one to compete with! Unlike apps such as Daylio, Uplifter, and Moodnotes, Blah does not track any progress of your emotions. Emotion tracking is pretty helpful for people with a therapist. It may not be effective for those that would rather vent and forget.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't want my thoughts recorded anywhere for anyone to grab; Would you? After a message is complete on BLAH, it gets swiped away and no information is stored. <br><br>The call feature behaves the same way. Nothing is recorded before, during, or after a call. It's just you yelling at your phone until you feel better. You won't hurt it's feelings, I promise.</p>

              <p>THE APP DOES NOT REPLACE THERAPY. I'm a big advocate for getting help when people need it most. It is meant as a forgetful journal and not to replace human interaction and comfort. <br><br> If a user feels like harming themselves, I’ve implemented a contact button to the National Suicide Prevention Line phone number next to the BLAH call button. This button actually calls the hotline so it should only be used in real emergencies.</p>
